# Temporal Workflow run diff tool

Based on mermaid diagrams format
Takes 2 workflow runs in mermaid format (the actual logic of denerating mermaid format is out of scope)
it then uses React and TypeScript to visuallize the difference

## Getting up and running

The template contains mostly the minimum dependencies to get up and running, but
also includes eslint and some additional rules to help you write React code that
is less likely to run into issues:

```bash
npm install # or `pnpm install` or `yarn install`
```

Vite is a great development server and build tool that we recommend our users to
use. You can start a development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

While the development server is running, changes you make to the code will be
automatically reflected in the browser!
